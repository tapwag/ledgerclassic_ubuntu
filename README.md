# ledgerclassic_ubuntu
The original SQL Ledger tarball. In this project I focus specifically on installation on Ubuntu server offerings.

# Things I have in mind

* Hardcoding UTF-8 support in configuration file
* Adding udonos Umsatzsteuerplugin (will probably take a while as I am not that proficient in Perl)
* Checking on Ubuntuserver if the bash script worked correctly
* Adding SKR04 Chart of Account (SKR04 Kontenrahmen)
* Updating SKR03 to reflect a later 2018 version
* Bringing the SQL dump to the latest taxation
